scattered free space in main memory
$0100..$01D0 more or less
$0228..$02FF with some effort
  NOTE: original game's input routine allows 256-byte
  input which will clobber all of page 2
  so this would have to be restricted if we want to
  use any space at all on page 2
$0300..$03CF is unused
$1C45..$1CFE is unused loader text (part of T3)
$1E79..$1EFF is unused loader text (part of T3)
$1F00..$1FFF is unused
game uses text screen
game uses screen holes
game uses actual ProDOS
game uses $BB00..$BEFF as 1K ProDOS file buffer
  but always closes files after use
  so theoretically could reuse for automation file access
  or scratch space for other things, but no persistence
must disable clock driver ($BF06:60)
  otherwise in-game ProDOS file access will clobber $200
  when game expects it to persist, game input will fail,
  and hilarity may or may not ensue
