General ideas for improvement (beyond porting to ProDOS):

- patch in a better input routine
  * auto-uppercase for games that need it (i.e. Sierra)
  * up arrow to retype last command
  * standardized prompt
  - command fixup (i.e. Scott Adams games that support TAKE but not GET)
  - tab completion of commands/directions/objects (game-specific)
    - Scott Adams games only store/check the first 3 letters of verbs and nouns
    - Sherwood Forest only stores/checks the first 5
  - hotkey to game help and other commands

- accelerate during drawing, decelerate for input
  (1 MHz during input is important for games that have short real-time components)
  - e.g. "The Quest v1.0" drawing routine starts at $A30 and ends at $A79
