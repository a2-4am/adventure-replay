restore game @ $74CF
only available at program startup
after selecting slot ("A"-"D"), jumps to $6923 -> $765C -> $7798
$7798 calls subroutine at $77CB that munges A (previously ASCII slot as input)
  into a sector number and stores it in a temporary address,
  and sets up RWTS address ($B7F0/1) to $4033
$779B calls subroutine at $7811 that sets RWTS track and sector and reads
$779E copies some of it to $41C7
$77A9 increments sector number in temporary storage
$77AC calls $7811 again for a second read (still into $4033)
$77AF copies some of it to ($4026) which seems to be $56DC

save game @ $152D
available at any time ("SAVE GAME" <return>)
