save game requires separate data disk which requires multi-disk support in RWTS shim

type "SAVE GAME" -> eventually jumps to $B39F to switch to text mode and present menu

1) INITIALIZE DATA DISK
2) SAVE GAME
3) EXIT

want to replace this with going directly to "SAVE GAME" option #2
BUT also need a way to get out of the loop once you're in it
(original forces you to choose A-D to save, no cancel by then)

choosing option #2 jumps to $B4C2 which displays prompt
"ENTER YOUR DATA DISK AND PRESS 'Y'" which we also want to skip

$B4D9 calls protection check (!) to distinguish data and program disk
which we also want to skip even though we've neutered it

$B4E3 calls $B747 to prompt "ENTER GAME SAVE AREA (A-D)" and require
one of those (no way to cancel)

lowest level save entry point is at $1744
calls $BD00 with a custom RWTS parameter table at $1778

setting $177A to #$02 ? but may need to set it back when it prompts
to reinsert the program disk
