prompt:

JSR at $836B copies the string "Buckaroo Banzai" to $0800 as a length-prefixed string
can not change the string because it is used elsewhere (in game intro text at least)
but changing $836B to STA $0800 makes $800 an zero-length string instead

JSR at $837E appends the string "," to the string at $800
changing $837E to $2C bypasses the string append

JSR at $83BA appends the string " I want you to " (stored at $839A, length-prefixed)
to the string at $800
it IS feasible to change the string at $839A to $02 $3E $20 ("> ")

later code copies $800 to $200, then even later code prints it out from $200
these are common routines for all game output and can't be modified

engine seems flexible enough to handle shortened prompt, probably because different
games use different prompts with different character names
