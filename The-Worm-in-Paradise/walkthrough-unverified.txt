-------------------------------------------------

(Later released as Part 3 of the 'Silicon Dreams Trilogy')


Before  describing a 'solution' to this adventure, it must be accepted that
there isn't a move-by-move solution from start to finish!
Only the very early part of the adventure is constant, as far as a solution
is concerned. This is due to two main features:

   (1)THE EDEN TRANSPORT SYSTEM - which throws up different address
                                  locations on each load of the game.

   (2)THE FUZBOTS OF ENOCH - who could crop up anywhere at any time.

These being, obviously, in addition to any normal problems you may generate
by the wrong action. Other notable features are:

   (3)The Enoch TIME system - be sure to be home before curfew is
                              imposed, and do not attempt to start a
                              job too late in the day or the
                              Workplace Droid will reject you!

   (4)Never be in debt - you cannot afford the fine AND complete
                         the game, so keep an eye on your Creds by
                         'EXAMINE TATTOO'.

THE EDEN TRANSPORT SYSTEM: Refer to your maps for clarification!

This consists of three 'ETS' Roundabouts, all accessible from the Northmost
roundabout. They are uniquely colour-coded by the FIRST COLOUR mentioned on
a grid location, as follows:

                   RED........the ETS 'EAST'
                   BROWN......the ETS 'NORTH'
                   BLACK......the ETS 'WEST'

When  entering  an  ETS  type  'JUMP' to reach the centre and 'SAY EXIT' to
leave (then SOUTH).

There are SIX important addresses on the ETS which you must visit, BUT they
may differ on each loading of the game!

                  1.YOUR HABIHOME
                  2.THE SOCIALIST'S HABIHOME
                  3.THE JOB CENTRE
                  4.THE TRAVEL AGENTS
                  5.THE FLORISTS
                  6.THE HARDWARE WAREHOUSE

The  first one (Your Habihome) is easy to find and you don't really need to
remember  this  address  -  just  type 'SAY HOME' in open areas, other than
exits  from  roundabouts  leading to an ETS, and you are deposited one move
North  of  your  Habihome  (SOUTH to enter). On leaving your Habihome, type
'SAY  EXIT'  then  'SOUTH'  and  you're  placed  somewhere on the Northmost
Roundabout, depending on your 'home' address.

The  second  one (Socialist's Habihome) is found by examining a brooch (see
Solution).

The  remaining  four  are  given  out  on  television  advertisements  (see
Solution).
The  different  addresses  found  so far may not provide for EVERY possible

(Note:-  Do  not  'type  ahead'  too  far  in advance as the parser becomes
confused!  If,  however,  you  become  'lost',  just  type 'JUMP' and start
working through the appropriate sequence of directions again.)

The  final  note before commencing the game is regarding the clock. It is a
decimal  clock (0-10).....5 is Midday and 10 is Midnight. 'Curfew' is 10-3.
Each 'hour' consists of 100 'minutes' - 'WAIT' command uses 10 minutes, any
other single input uses 1 minute.

It  is  wise  to  tackle  the adventure in 'day stages' but don't waste any
'days'  because  after about a week the Fuzbots get fed up of you wandering
about  and fine you for being a parasite of the state, irrespective of your
work record!!


                               THE SOLUTION

Beautiful Octagonal Room).

DAYS 1&2.
(Don't worry about the odd fine of 9 Creds)

YOUR HABIHOME
The  poster is really a television screen. SAY ON to operate it, or SAY OFF
to  close  it  down. In the Bodymaint is a nozzle - SAY ON for a refreshing
shower  but  remove your tradclads or other clothing first! The shower will
remind you of this!! If you don't shower REGULARLY the Droids may refuse to
serve you.

The crack in the wall is your bed slot. SAY BED and it will swing down. LIE
ON  BED  to  use  it. If you SAY BED while you're still on it you are swung
down  to the Undercity below your Habihome, but wait until you're sure that
you  know how to get out again before you try this! When your tattoo buzzes
and  announces  'Curfew  in 1 hour', type SLEEP while on the bed and make a
note of your 'dream'.....it may prove useful!

REMOVE  TRADCLADS  -  N  -  SAY ON - (have a shower) - WEAR TRADCLADS - S -
EXAMINE POSTER - SAY ON - EXAMINE TATTOO - (note the time and the amount of
Creds  you have) - (continue to EXAMINE POSTER or even EXAMINE TV until you
have  got  the  addresses  of  the  JOBCENTRE,  TRAVEL AGENTS, FLORISTS and
HARDWARE  WAREHOUSE.......it  may  take  quite  a while but they all appear
eventually!)  -  SAY BED - LIE ON BED - (when curfew is announced.......) -
SLEEP.

DAY 3.
(Refer to maps and ETS notes for directions)
Go  to  the Florist's Shop, buy the wreath, leave the ETS and make your way
to  the  Memorial in the Theme Park. DROP the wreath at the Memorial. Go to
the  Jobcentre  and take a job as a Clerk. If you're offered a YTS/YOP job,
SAY  NO  and she'll offer you a job as a Clerk, eventually - if she doesn't
you'll have to return the next day......maybe you haven't showered!

Take  the  card  to  the Workplace and go DOWN. After your days work you're
escorted out again. SAY HOME and go SOUTH into your Habihome. Go to bed and
SLEEP after curfew is announced.

DAY 4.
Visit  the  Jobcentre  again and get a job as a Labourer (turn down YTS/YOP
and  the Clerks job), take the card and proceed to the Workplace. This time
upon  entering  you're  taken  to  a  Workshop.  Go WEST and you are in the
Waldroid  Control  Cocoon.  You  now assume the role of the Waldroid in the
Workshop.  Go  EAST  and  make  your  way  to  the Hardware Warehouse. (The
Waldroid  behaves  exactly  as  if it was you moving about, i.e., JUMP, SAY
EXIT, etc).

Buy  the  valve. You obtain it for nothing on the council rates; if you had
tried  to  buy  it as yourself it would have cost you 1000 Creds! Return to
the  Workshop  -  the  Waldroid  controls die and you return to your normal
role. EXAMINE the WALDROID on the way out and TAKE VALVE. Go home, drop the
valve, WAIT until curfew is announced then SLEEP.

DAY 5.
Have  a shower and proceed to the Pet Shop in the Pleasure Dome (9 Creds to
go  NORTH through the turnstile). There is a Dagget here that was 800 Creds
on Day 1 but is now only 500 Creds. BUY DAGGET.

THE DAGGET
This  is  a robot dog.....EXAMINE it to reveal that it is a kind of plastic
labrador!  It operates on batteries through a Batpak (spelling is important
-  the program doesn't respond to Batpack!!). There is no need to carry the
Dagget  for as long as he is fitted with the Batpak he'll follow you around
and you don't risk getting fined for possessing him then! To immobilise the
Dagget,  or  stop  him from following you, REMOVE BATPAK and then drop it .
The  Dagget  winds down after a few moves. Ignore the majority of his crazy
antics....they appear purely for show!

Go  to  the  Museum  and  REMOVE BATPAK. You now have to steal a Helmet and
Leotard from the exhibition without anyone seeing you do it or leaving with
the  stolen  items.  Also  there  is  a  security screen covering them. The
exception  to  the latter rule is when the Tourist Guide comes in and shows
the exhibits to some tourists.

WAIT  until the tourists leave, then TAKE HELMET AND LEOTARD (you only have
ONE  move  before  the  screen  comes  down again!). PUT HELMET IN DAGGET -
REMOVE  TRADCLADS - WEAR LEOTARD - WEAR TRADCLADS.......no-one is any wiser
as  to  your  misdeeds now. Don't forget to TAKE DAGGET and then go back to
your Habihome.

REMOVE  HELMET  -  DROP  HELMET  - REMOVE TRADCLADS - REMOVE LEOTARD - DROP
LEOTARD - WEAR TRADCLADS - PUT BATPAK IN DAGGET.

Take  the  brooch  from  the wallet and go to the Socialist's Habihome. The
Dagget  will  find  an Invitation for you. Return home with the Invitation.
Remove  the  Batpak from the Dagget and DROP BATPAK. Examine the Invitation
and  note  the  time of the meeting (usually at '6'). Drop the brooch, take
the  medallion  and  valve,  together  with  the invitation. WAIT until the
Dagget  grinds  to a halt then go to the Bison's Temple at the far North of
the  Pleasure Dome Corridor. Time is important here, as you're only allowed
a couple of minutes leeway from the time stated.

WAIT  or  go SOUTH then NORTH until ONE MINUTE BEFORE the appointed time of
the  meeting.......remembering  that  a  'move'  is ONE minute, WAIT is TEN
minutes. (EXAMINE TATTOO regularly).

At  the  appointed  time,  enter the Temple and WAIT until the Bison leader
comes  out to meet you. Joining fee is 100 Creds. After becoming a Bison go
WEST  to  the Temple Bar and BUY the Bottle of Wine, then go home. Drop the
medallion,  valve  and bottle and leave the Dagget for now. Take the wallet
and  brooch, together with your invitation, and hand them in to the Police,
at  the Police Station, in the order:- GIVE INVITATION - GIVE BROOCH - GIVE
WALLET.  They  tell  you something you already know and you receive a small
reward  -  EXAMINE TATTOO. Return home, have a shower and SLEEP when curfew
is announced.

DAY 6.
TAKE  BATPAK - PUT BATPAK IN DAGGET. (You need him for the next task). Have
a shower again and proceed to the Jobcentre yet again. Turn down everything
and  as  the Droid shakes our hand it realises that you are now a Bison and
offers  you  a  job  as  a  Managing Director. Go to the Workplace with the
Dagget.  This time, upon entry, you're shown to a Fabulous Office entrance.
Go  NORTH and you're up to your neck in carpet - but the Dagget keeps it at
bay  so  as  not  to  impede  your  progress.  Go  WEST to your desk in the
Boardroom.  After  your  day's work you're escorted out - with not a little
increase in Creds. (EXAMINE TATTOO!).

Make  your  way  to  the Travel Agent's and buy a ticket. You couldn't have
bought  it before because it only sells to Bisons, but make sure you've had
a   shower  that  day!  Go  home,  WAIT  until  curfew  is  announced  then
SLEEP.......you're going need all your wits for the last day!!

DAY 7.
This  is  the final day and it is essential that you 'SAVE' game up to this
point as a lot of things could still happen - even on the last move!!

Don't  worry  about  the  time  or  Creds, you'll soon have plenty of both,
providing you're in the right place with the right equipment.

Deactivate  the Dagget (REMOVE BATPAK - WAIT) and after your morning shower
proceed  to the Hardware Warehouse and buy the Vidcam, (cost is 300 Creds).
Return home, get the ticket, ensure that you are still carrying the Vidcam,
then SAY BED - LIE ON BED - SAY BED.

You  are taken down to the Undercity. Refer to the map and proceed SOUTH to
the  Disgusting  Junction.  Go WEST and TAKE SIGN then DROP the sign at the
Disgusting  Junction. It tells the Droids where the rubbish and junk should
be deposited......they always leave it by this sign!

Go back to the Cluttered Stained Room (WEST) and you'll notice a Junk Heap.
The  cleaning  Droids will eventually move this to wherever you have placed
the  sign  -  but you must be very patient! When the junk heap is all moved
from this location an exit South through a grill is revealed. A more useful
exit,  that  was  there  all  the  time  but  not mentioned in the location
description, is North past the Waterfall to a ledge behind!

Move  NORTH  ONCE  ONLY from behind the waterfall and you will see a Flying
Saucer. The wiggly roots before you are part of an alarm/gas system so stay
put!  SQUEEZE  VIDCAM to record the scene then proceed SOUTH - SOUTH - EAST
to the Disgusting Junction. If the junk heap has not appeared here yet then
have  a walk around (or WAIT) awhile. When the junk heap materialises CLIMB
HEAP then UP, and you pass through the manhole - one way - to the Workplace
Roundabout Exit of the Southmost Roundabout.

Proceed to the Police Station and GIVE VIDCAM. Go to the Riverboat Platform
in  the  Theme  Park and then NORTH to cross the river to the Island of the
Mighty.  (This  is  ONE-WAY once only!). Follow the map to the South of the
Fabulous Foyer where you see a Reception Droid. On arrival you are escorted
by  elevator  to  the  Top  Floor  and  subsequently  interviewed about the
'aliens'  on  television.  The  3rd  Kimberley rewards you (1000 Creds) and
makes you a Party Member. You are then taken back home.

                         FINAL SEQUENCE OF EVENTS

REMOVE  TRADCLADS - (but still carry them!) - TAKE LEOTARD - WEAR LEOTARD -
TAKE  HELMET  - TAKE BOTTLE - TAKE MEDALLION - TAKE VALVE - (these latter 2
items to trigger the alarm) - TAKE BOX - PUT BATPAK IN DAGGET - (Now is his
finest hour!) - TAKE DAGGET - (he won't necessarily follow you on this one)
- SAY BED - LIE ON BED - SAY BED.

Drop  the  Dagget and proceed to the Disgusting Junction. Take the sign and
go EAST to the location described as 'Between Dry Pillars' and festooned in
red  tape.  Drop  the  sign  here, then proceed: WEST - WEST - NORTH - WEAR
HELMET  -  THROW  MEDALLION  NORTH - the alarm sounds and gas flows in....a
Technician  from  the  Saucer will look out, see no-one and proclaim 'False
Alarm'.  THROW  VALVE NORTH......the Technician records another false alarm
and  orders  the  system  to  be  shut  down  until  Maintenance  check  it
over.......BUT  this  is NOT immediate so WAIT at least FOUR TIMES until an
occupant of the Saucer has looked out another TWICE!

Now  go  NORTH  -  NORTH  for  a  bit of a surprise! (This is where you say
goodbye to your old friend......wipes tears of emotion away and cancels the
Kennomeat!).  TAKE  COSTUME  then EAST to the East/West Corridor (see Map).
Remove  and drop the helmet and leotard here then WEAR TRADCLADS. Go to the
Red  Tape  location and WAIT until the Junk Heap materialises. When it does
CLIMB  HEAP then UP. This time, however, the manhole is rusted up somewhat,
so  REMOVE  CORK......the  cork pops out of the bottle and wine sprays over
everything, lubricating the manhole cover.

IMPORTANT NOTE: TAKE CORK....you'll need this right at the end!!

UP and you are in the Quad, South of the Pyramid of Power. Proceed NORTH to
the Fabulous Foyer then NORTHEAST - NORTH - EXAMINE BUTTONS - (they are all
different colours but WHITE is the one for you!) - PUSH WHITE BUTTON - (the
Elevator  goes  only  so far towards your required destination, so......) -
PUSH WHITE BUTTON again, and you're on the Top Floor.

Proceed  SOUTH then EAST past the Pyramid Droid and you are confronted by a
mirror.  PUSH MIRROR and it revolves depositing you at the base of a Spiral
Staircase.  Go  UP  -  THROW  BOX  NORTH - it lands below the partition and
causes   a   malfunction.   Continue  NORTH  then  NORTH  again.  Now  fire
extinguisher  foam  starts  to  pour  in  from  an orifice!......your final
command is to PUT CORK IN ORIFICE!!!!!!


                               FINAL MESSAGE

"You  block  the  orifice and stop the foam. You threaten to tell the truth
about  fake  aliens  and  wave  the  costume as proof. Eventually a deal is
struck.  You  give  back the alien costume and, in return, are adopted into
the Party Leadership. Congratulations! You have won!"

      "You score 1000 out of 1000 and are a Grandmaster Adventurer".
