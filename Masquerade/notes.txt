save game routine entry point $4C10 (first thing called after typing "SAVE GAME" <Return>)
$4C30 calls $0806 to display "GAME NUMBER? (1-7)" prompt (inline after call, 0-terminated)
$4C4A calls $0809 to get input, stores in $300+
$4C4D checks first character of input and maps it to an integer #$01..#$07
$4C5A multiplies that by 2 and stores it in $4CEB
  which is the sector ID in a DOS-style RWTS parameter table starting at $4CE6
starting address is $1E00
track is #$00
$4C63 calls $4CDE to write 1 sector (via $BD00)
$4C68 increments sector and address by 1
$4C6E calls $4CDE again

so entire save state is $200 bytes, in memory @ $1E00..$1FFF (possibly put there temporarily during save, not persistent?)
stored on disk in two consecutive sectors on track 0
  slot 1 -> sectors 2-3
  slot 2 -> sectors 4-5
  slot 3 -> sectors 6-7
  slot 4 -> sectors 8-9
  slot 5 -> sectors A-B
  slot 6 -> sectors C-D
  slot 7 -> sectors E-F

restore game reads save data into $A800..$A9FF instead

-=-=-

offset $1F0 in save data contains room ID XOR #$13

$6C40 is table of addresses to room record, 2 bytes per ID
entire room record is XOR #$55
room record first #$0F bytes is room info + exits string
  then room name in uppercase, terminated by #$0D
