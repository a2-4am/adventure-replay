save

command is SAVE GAME, not just SAVE, sigh
already supports 9 save slots, actually 10 (0-9)
after prompt and input check, execution continues at $BF3
pushes save slot ASCII
$BF7 "prints" carriage return (null-terminated string on stack)
$BFC pulls save slot ASCII, converts to #$00-#$09
converts save slot to start track/sector via tables at $BB3/$BBD
writes $200 bytes from $4000..$41FF to 2 consecutive sectors
fun fact: when game starts, it loads a save state from track $22, sector $E-$F
  which is not accessible from LOAD GAME but is immediately after slot 9 on disk
can patch save at $0C00 exactly, where A contains save slot #$00-#$09
can just JMP to our custom code, rest of routine is devoted to writing
save patch can just RTS

restore

command is LOAD GAME, not just LOAD, sigh
RESTORE GAME also works (but not just RESTORE, double sigh)
can patch restore at $B97, where A contains restore slot #$00-#$09
restore patch should exit via JMP $084F

secondary protection

before GO WINDOW to board alien ship (about halfway through the game),
game prompts for front side of disk and does another protection check,
then prompts for flip side again

flag is at $415C, change from #$00 to #$01 to make game think it's
already done the delayed protection check (thus never shows messages)

NOTE: this is in the save/restore game data buffer
